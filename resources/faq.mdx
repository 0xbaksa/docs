### What happens if a payment fails?

## API & Integration

### How do I get started?

1. Sign up at [card2crypto.cc](https://card2crypto.cc)
2. Complete seller onboarding
3. Wait for approval (usually 24-48 hours)
4. Create your shop and get API keys
5. Integrate using our [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart)

### What programming languages are supported?

Card2Crypto provides a REST API that works with any language. We have guides for:
- [Node.js](/guides/nodejs)
- [PHP](/guides/php)
- Python (coming soon)

Any language that can make HTTP requests will work.

### Do I need a webhook endpoint?

Webhooks are highly recommended but not required. Without webhooks, you'll need to poll the API to check payment status, which is less efficient.

### How do I test my integration?

Card2Crypto operates in production mode only. Test with:
- Small payment amounts ($0.50 minimum)
- Your own credit cards
- Real API keys

See [Testing Guide](/resources/testing) for details.

### Can I use test mode?

No. Card2Crypto only has production mode. All payments are real transactions.

## Security

### Is Card2Crypto secure?

Yes. Security features include:
- secure payment processing (PCI Level 1 certified)
- HTTPS encryption for all connections
- HMAC-SHA256 webhook signatures
- API key authentication
- No credit card data stored on your servers

### Do I need to be PCI compliant?

No. Card details go directly from customer to our secure processor. Your server never touches credit card data, so you don't need PCI certification.

### How do I verify webhooks are authentic?

All webhooks include an HMAC-SHA256 signature in the `X-Card2Crypto-Signature` header. Verify this signature using your webhook secret.

See [Webhook Security](/webhooks/security) for implementation details.

### What if someone steals my API key?

If your API key is compromised:
1. Go to your shop settings
2. Click "Regenerate API Key"
3. Update your application with the new key
4. The old key will be immediately invalidated

### How do i secure my API keys?

Always store API keys in environment variables and add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.

## Withdrawals

### How do I withdraw my balance?

1. Go to [Dashboard > Balance](https://card2crypto.cc/dashboard/balance)
2. Click "Request Withdrawal"
3. Enter your Bitcoin or Litecoin address
4. Enter the amount to withdraw
5. Submit request
6. Admin approves and processes withdrawal (usually within 24 hours)

### What cryptocurrencies can I withdraw to?

- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Litecoin (LTC)

### How long do withdrawals take?

Withdrawals are typically processed within 24 hours of request. Blockchain confirmation time varies:
- Bitcoin: 10-60 minutes
- Litecoin: 2.5-15 minutes

### What are the withdrawal fees?

No platform fee. You only pay the blockchain network fee:
- Bitcoin: ~$1-5 (variable based on network congestion)
- Litecoin: ~$0.01-0.50 (variable based on network congestion)

### Should I use Bitcoin or Litecoin?

For smaller withdrawals, Litecoin is often better due to lower fees. For larger withdrawals, either works well.

```
$100 withdrawal:
  Bitcoin:  Receive ~$95-99 (1-5% in fees)
  Litecoin: Receive ~$99.50-99.90 (0.1-0.5% in fees)

$10,000 withdrawal:
  Bitcoin:  Receive ~$9,995-9,999 (0.01-0.05% in fees)
  Litecoin: Receive ~$9,999.50-9,999.90 (0.001-0.005% in fees)
```

## Checkout Experience

### Can I customize the checkout page?

Currently, you can customize:
- Shop name (displayed on checkout)
- Return URL (where customer goes after payment)

Logo and color customization coming soon.

### Is the checkout page mobile-friendly?

Yes. The checkout page is fully responsive and works on all devices.

### What information do customers see?

Customers see:
- Your shop name
- Payment amount
- Credit card form
- Secure payment badge

They do NOT see:
- Your API keys
- Cryptocurrency mentions
- Your payout details

### Can customers cancel a payment?

Yes. Customers can close the checkout page at any time. If they don't complete payment, the status remains "pending" and no charge occurs.

### Do checkout URLs expire?

No. Checkout URLs don't expire, but best practice is to generate a fresh URL for each payment attempt.

## Webhooks

### What webhook events are sent?

- `payment.completed` - Payment succeeded
- `payment.failed` - Payment failed
- `payment.refunded` - Payment was refunded

### How many times will a webhook be retried?

Failed webhooks are retried 3 times with exponential backoff:
- Retry 1: After 2 seconds
- Retry 2: After 4 seconds
- Retry 3: After 8 seconds (final attempt)

### Can I receive webhooks for test payments?

Yes. All payments (including small test payments) trigger webhooks.

### How do I test webhooks locally?

Use ngrok or a similar tool to expose your local server:

```bash
# Start your server
npm start

# Start ngrok
ngrok http 3000

# Use ngrok URL in webhook settings
https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/card2crypto
```

See [Webhook Testing](/webhooks/testing) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Why isn't my webhook being called?

Check:
1. Is your webhook URL correct and publicly accessible?
2. Is your server running and accepting POST requests?
3. Are there firewall rules blocking Card2Crypto?
4. Check webhook logs in your dashboard for error details

### Why is signature verification failing?

Common causes:
1. Using wrong webhook secret (not API key)
2. Body parsing middleware modifying the payload
3. Using wrong hashing algorithm (must be HMAC-SHA256)

See [Webhook Security](/webhooks/security) for correct implementation.

### Why am I getting rate limited?

The API limits requests to 100 per minute per API key. Solutions:
- Implement request queuing
- Use exponential backoff for retries
- Cache API responses
- Use webhooks instead of polling

See [Rate Limits](/resources/rate-limits) for details.

### Why is my payment failing?

Common causes:
- Amount below $0.50 minimum
- Invalid API key
- Missing return_url
- Invalid currency (must be "usd")
- Card declined by processor

Check the error message for specific details.

### How do I get support?

- Check this FAQ
- Read the [documentation](/introduction)
- Contact support through your dashboard
- Email support (check dashboard for contact info)

## Business Questions

## Technical Questions

### What API version should I use?

Always use the latest version: `v1`

Base URL: `https://card2crypto.cc/api/v1`

### How do I handle idempotency?

Include an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique value:

```javascript
headers: {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer c2c_live_...',
  'Idempotency-Key': 'unique_order_123'
}
```

Requests with the same key within 24 hours return the same result.

### Can I make API calls from the frontend?

**No!** Never expose API keys in frontend code. Always make API calls from your backend server.

### What should I do with the payment ID in the return URL?

Retrieve the payment to verify its status:

```javascript
app.get('/success', async (req, res) => {
  const payment = await getPayment(req.query.payment_id);

  if (payment.status === 'completed') {
    // Grant access to product
  }
});
```

### How do I handle concurrent payments?

No special handling needed. Each payment is independent. You can create multiple payments simultaneously without issues.
