## Platform Fee

Card2Crypto charges a flat **15% fee** on all successful transactions.

```
Customer pays: $100.00
Platform fee:   $15.00 (15%)
You receive:    $85.00
```

## What's Included

The 15% platform fee covers:

- Payment gateway infrastructure
- White-labeled checkout pages
- Webhook delivery and automatic retries
- 24/7 transaction monitoring
- Fraud detection and prevention
- Crypto withdrawal processing
- Credit card processing fees
- Customer support

## Fee Calculation

### Example 1: Basic Payment

```
Customer payment:    $100.00
Platform fee (15%):  - $15.00
Your balance:        = $85.00
```

## No Hidden Fees

There are **NO** additional fees for:

- API requests
- Webhook delivery
- Failed payment attempts
- Refunds (fee is returned to you)
- Multiple shops (you can only have one)
- Dashboard access
- Crypto withdrawals

## Minimum Amounts

### Minimum Payment

**\$0.50 USD** per transaction

```javascript
// Minimum valid payment
{
  "amount": 50,  // $0.50 in cents
  "currency": "usd"
}

// This will fail
{
  "amount": 49,  // Too low
  "currency": "usd"
}
```

### Minimum Withdrawal

**\$10.00 USD** minimum balance required to request a crypto withdrawal

Why?

- Covers blockchain transaction fees
- Ensures economical crypto transfers
- Prevents dust withdrawals

## Refund Fees

When a payment is refunded:

1. Customer receives full refund (\$100.00)
2. Platform fee is returned to your balance (\$15.00)
3. Your net balance change is \$0

You're only out the amount you received (\$85), not the full payment amount.

## Failed Payments

**No fees charged** for failed or declined payments.

You only pay the 15% fee when a payment successfully completes.

## Withdrawal Fees

### Bitcoin (BTC)

No platform fee for withdrawals. You only pay the blockchain network fee (variable based on network congestion).

Typical network fee: $1-$5 depending on Bitcoin network conditions

### Litecoin (LTC)

No platform fee for withdrawals. You only pay the blockchain network fee (variable based on network congestion).

Typical network fee: $0.01-$0.50 depending on Litecoin network conditions

### Why Litecoin May Be Better

For smaller withdrawals, Litecoin often makes more sense:

```
Bitcoin withdrawal:
  Balance: $100.00
  Network fee: ~$3.00
  You receive: ~$97.00 (97%)

Litecoin withdrawal:
  Balance: $100.00
  Network fee: ~$0.10
  You receive: ~$99.90 (99.9%)
```

## Balance Management

Your balance is credited instantly when payments complete:

```
Starting balance:    $0.00
Payment 1 ($100):   + $85.00
Payment 2 ($50):    + $42.50
Payment 3 ($200):   + $170.00
Current balance:     $297.50
```

- Users who value privacy (no KYC)
- Merchants who want crypto payouts
- Small to medium transaction volumes
