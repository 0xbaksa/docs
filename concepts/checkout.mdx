## How Checkout Works

When you create a payment via the API, Card2Crypto generates a unique checkout URL where your customer completes the payment.

```
https://card2crypto.cc/checkout/pay_abc123xyz789
```

## Checkout Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Clicks Pay">
    Customer initiates payment on your website
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your Server Creates Payment">
    Your backend calls the Card2Crypto API to create a payment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redirect to Checkout URL">
    Redirect customer to the checkout_url from API response
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Enters Card">
    Customer enters credit card information on checkout page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Processed">
    Card2Crypto processes the payment securely
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to Your Site">
    Customer redirected back to your return_url with payment ID
  </Step>
</Steps>

## White-Labeled Experience

The checkout page is fully branded with your shop name and logo. Customers see your branding throughout the payment process, not Card2Crypto's.

### What Customers See

- Your shop name in the page title
- Your shop name in the payment description
- Clean, professional payment form
- Secure secure payment processing
- Mobile-responsive design

### What Customers Don't See

- Card2Crypto branding (minimal footer only)
- Cryptocurrency mentions
- Your API keys or backend details

## Creating Checkout Sessions

### Basic Example

```javascript
// 1. Create payment on your server
const response = await fetch('https://card2crypto.cc/api/v1/payments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer c2c_live_...',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 10000, // $100.00
    currency: 'usd',
    return_url: 'https://yoursite.com/success'
  })
});

const payment = await response.json();

// 2. Redirect customer to checkout
window.location.href = payment.data.checkout_url;
```

### With Customer Information

Pre-fill customer email and name for a better experience:

```javascript
const payment = await createPayment({
  amount: 10000,
  currency: 'usd',
  return_url: 'https://yoursite.com/success',
  customer_email: 'customer@example.com',
  customer_name: 'John Doe'
});

// Customer sees their name and email pre-filled
redirect(payment.data.checkout_url);
```

### With Metadata

Pass order information to track the payment:

```javascript
const payment = await createPayment({
  amount: 10000,
  currency: 'usd',
  return_url: 'https://yoursite.com/success',
  metadata: {
    order_id: '1234',
    product: 'Premium Plan',
    subscription_period: 'monthly'
  }
});
```

This metadata is returned in webhooks and when retrieving payment details.

## Return URL Behavior

After payment (success or failure), the customer is redirected to your return_url with the payment ID:

```
https://yoursite.com/success?payment_id=pay_abc123xyz789
```

### Handle Return URL

```javascript
// Express.js example
app.get('/success', async (req, res) => {
  const paymentId = req.query.payment_id;

  if (!paymentId) {
    return res.status(400).send('Missing payment ID');
  }

  // Retrieve payment to check status
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://card2crypto.cc/api/v1/payments/${paymentId}`,
    {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.CARD2CRYPTO_API_KEY}`
      }
    }
  );

  const payment = await response.json();

  if (payment.data.status === 'completed') {
    res.send('Thank you for your payment!');
  } else if (payment.data.status === 'pending') {
    res.send('Payment is being processed...');
  } else {
    res.send('Payment failed. Please try again.');
  }
});
```

### Return URL Best Practices

1. **Always verify payment status** - Don't trust the return URL alone
2. **Use HTTPS** - Ensure your return URL uses HTTPS
3. **Include order context** - Add query params to identify the order:
   ```javascript
   return_url: `https://yoursite.com/success?order_id=${orderId}`
   ```
4. **Handle missing payment_id** - Validate the parameter exists

## Checkout Page Security

### PCI Compliance

Card2Crypto handles all PCI compliance requirements. Your server never touches credit card data.

- Card information goes directly from customer to our secure processor
- You don't need PCI certification
- No card data stored on your servers

### Payment Security

- Secure payment processing
- 3D Secure authentication for fraud prevention
- SSL/TLS encryption for all data
- HMAC signatures for webhook verification

### Customer Data

Customer email and name (if provided) are:
- Stored encrypted in Card2Crypto's database
- Only accessible via API with your API key
- Never shared with third parties
- Included in webhooks to your server

## Mobile Experience

The checkout page is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices:

- Touch-friendly input fields
- Mobile-optimized card input
- Works on all screen sizes
- Fast loading times

## Payment Methods

Currently supported:
- All major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover)
- Debit cards

Not currently supported:
- Apple Pay / Google Pay (coming soon)
- Bank transfers
- PayPal
- Cryptocurrency direct payments

## Checkout Expiration

Checkout URLs don't expire. Customers can complete payment at any time after the URL is generated.

However, best practice is to:
- Generate fresh URLs for each payment attempt
- Don't reuse checkout URLs
- Cancel old pending payments if customer creates new ones

## Error Handling

### Payment Declined

If a payment is declined:
1. Customer sees error message on checkout page
2. Customer can try a different card
3. Status remains `pending` (not `failed`)
4. No webhook is sent for declined attempts

Only when customer abandons checkout or final failure occurs will status become `failed`.

### Network Errors

If customer loses connection during payment:
- Customer can refresh and try again
- Payment status can be checked via API

### Timeout

Checkout sessions don't timeout. Customer can return to the URL later to complete payment.

## Customization

### Current Customization Options

- Shop name (shown on checkout page)
- Return URL (where customer goes after payment)

### Not Customizable (Yet)

- Logo upload
- Color scheme
- Custom fields
- Payment page layout

These features may be added in future updates.

## Testing Checkout

### Development Testing

1. Create a test payment with a small amount ($0.50 minimum)
2. Use your production API keys
3. Use real credit card (will be charged)
4. Test the complete flow:
   - Create payment
   - Redirect to checkout
   - Enter real card details
   - Complete payment
   - Verify return URL redirect
   - Check webhook delivery

### Test Cards

Card2Crypto uses our live payment processor. Use real cards for testing.

For development, use small amounts:
```javascript
amount: 50  // $0.50 - minimum amount
```

## Monitoring Checkouts

Track checkout performance in your dashboard:

- View all pending payments
- See which payments are completed
- Monitor failed payments
- Check customer emails

## Best Practices

### 1. Generate Checkout URLs Server-Side

Never generate checkout URLs in frontend code:

```javascript
// BAD - Exposes API key
const checkout = await fetch('https://card2crypto.cc/api/v1/payments', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer c2c_live_...' } // Never expose API keys!
});

// GOOD - Generate on backend
app.post('/checkout', async (req, res) => {
  const checkout = await createPayment();
  res.json({ checkout_url: checkout.data.checkout_url });
});
```

### 2. Validate Return URLs

Don't rely solely on return URL for fulfillment:

```javascript
// BAD - Trusts return URL without verification
app.get('/success', async (req, res) => {
  await fulfillOrder(); // Dangerous! No verification
});

// GOOD - Verifies payment status
app.get('/success', async (req, res) => {
  const payment = await getPayment(req.query.payment_id);
  if (payment.status === 'completed') {
    await fulfillOrder();
  }
});
```

### 3. Use Webhooks for Fulfillment

Return URLs can be skipped by users. Use webhooks for reliable fulfillment:

```javascript
// Webhook handler (reliable)
app.post('/webhooks/card2crypto', (req, res) => {
  if (req.body.event === 'payment.completed') {
    fulfillOrder(req.body.payment.metadata.order_id);
  }
  res.send('OK');
});
```

### 4. Provide Clear Return URLs

Use descriptive return URLs that indicate what happened:

```javascript
// Good return URLs
return_url: 'https://yoursite.com/order-confirmation'
return_url: 'https://yoursite.com/payment-complete'
return_url: 'https://yoursite.com/thank-you'

// Bad return URLs
return_url: 'https://yoursite.com/callback' // Unclear purpose
return_url: 'https://yoursite.com/page' // Vague
```
