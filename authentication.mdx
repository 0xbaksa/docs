## API Keys

Card2Crypto uses API keys to authenticate requests. All requests must include your production API key in the `Authorization` header.

### Key Format

Production API keys follow this format:

```
c2c_live_[64-character-hexadecimal-string]
```

Example:
```
c2c_live_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6a7b8c9d0e1f2
```

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your [Dashboard](https://card2crypto.cc/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **API Keys**
3. Create your shop (one per account)
4. Copy your production API key

<Warning>
Your API key is shown only once during shop creation. Store it securely - if you lose it, you'll need to delete and recreate your shop.
</Warning>

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer scheme:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://card2crypto.cc/api/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer c2c_live_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "amount": 5000,
    "currency": "usd"
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://card2crypto.cc/api/v1/payments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer c2c_live_your_api_key_here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 5000,
    currency: 'usd'
  })
});
```

```php PHP
$ch = curl_init('https://card2crypto.cc/api/v1/payments');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer c2c_live_your_api_key_here',
    'Content-Type: application/json'
]);
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer c2c_live_your_api_key_here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.post(
    'https://card2crypto.cc/api/v1/payments',
    headers=headers,
    json={'amount': 5000, 'currency': 'usd'}
)
```

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Keys Server-Side">
    Never expose your API key in client-side JavaScript, mobile apps, or public repositories.

    **Bad:**
    ```html
    <script>
      // DON'T DO THIS
      const apiKey = 'c2c_live_...';
      fetch('/api/payments', {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
      });
    </script>
    ```

    **Good:**
    ```javascript
    // Server-side (Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.)
    const apiKey = process.env.CARD2CRYPTO_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables">
    Store your API key in environment variables, never hard-code it:

    ```bash .env
    CARD2CRYPTO_API_KEY=c2c_live_your_api_key_here
    ```

    Then access it in your code:
    ```javascript
    const apiKey = process.env.CARD2CRYPTO_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate Keys if Compromised">
    If your API key is exposed:
    1. Delete your shop in the dashboard
    2. Create a new shop to get a fresh API key
    3. Update your integration with the new key

    <Warning>
    Deleting your shop will invalidate all existing API keys immediately.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Restrict Access">
    Only grant access to your API key to trusted team members. Consider:
    - Using a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
    - Implementing role-based access control
    - Auditing who has access to production credentials
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Authentication Errors

### 401 Unauthorized

Returned when the API key is missing, invalid, or malformed.

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key"
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Incorrect key format (not `c2c_live_...`)
- Using a deleted or expired key
- Key belongs to inactive seller account

### 403 Forbidden

Returned when the seller account is inactive or suspended.

```json
{
  "error": "Seller account inactive"
}
```

**Resolution:**
Contact support at support@card2crypto.cc if your account is unexpectedly inactive.

## Testing Authentication

Use this simple test to verify your API key works:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl https://card2crypto.cc/api/v1/payments/test \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer c2c_live_your_api_key_here"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://card2crypto.cc/api/v1/payments/test', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer c2c_live_your_api_key_here'
  }
});

if (response.ok) {
  console.log('Authentication successful!');
} else {
  console.error('Authentication failed:', await response.text());
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## One Shop Per Account

<Note>
Card2Crypto enforces a **one shop per seller account** limit. This means:
- You get one production API key
- All payments go through this single shop
- If you need multiple shops, create separate seller accounts

This simplifies management and ensures clean separation of business entities.
</Note>

## Next Steps

Now that you understand authentication, learn how to create payments:

  icon="credit-card"
  href="/api-reference/payments/create"
>
  Learn how to process your first payment
</Card>
